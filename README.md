# Cyber Security Internship â€“ Task 1

## Objective:
Perform a TCP SYN scan using Nmap on my local network to identify open ports and potential security risks.

## Tools Used:

- Kali Linux
- Wireshark (optional)

## IP Range Used:
192.168.147.0/24

## Steps Performed:
1. Found local IP using `ifconfig`
2. Ran TCP SYN scan using:
3. Captured results and noted:
- Host 192.168.147.120 has port 53 open (DNS service)
- Other hosts have all ports filtered or ignored
4. Saved results in `scanresult.txt`
5. Took screenshots as proof of activity

## Outcome:
- Gained basic understanding of port scanning
- Identified running services and network exposure

## Screenshot Proof:
